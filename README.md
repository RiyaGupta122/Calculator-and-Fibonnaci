Calculator Program contains three files Main.java, UserInput.java, Calculator.java and Fibonnaci program

#Calculator

This repository contains a simple calculator program written in Java, with additional functionality for array operations.

##Main.java

This is the main entry point for the program. It initializes the calculator and can be used to perform various calculations.

##UserInput.java

This class provides functions for user input, including obtaining a single number and an array of numbers.

###Methods:

- `getNumberInput(String message)`: Takes a message as a parameter, displays the message to the user, and returns an integer input.

- `getArrayInput()`: Takes the size of the array as input, prompts the user to enter the elements, and returns an integer array.

##Calculator.java

This class contains various mathematical operations, both for basic arithmetic and array operations.

###Basic Arithmetic Operations:

- `add(int a, int b)`: Adds two numbers and returns the result.

- `subtract(int a, int b)`: Subtracts the second number from the first and returns the result.

- `multiply(int a, int b)`: Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.

- `divide(int a, int b)`: Divides the first number by the second and returns the result. Throws an `ArithmeticException` if the second number is zero.

###Array Operations:

- Additional methods can be found in this class for array operations, such as sum, mean, mode, median, variance, and standard deviation.

##Fibonacci.java

A simple program to generate the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms.

##Usage 

1. Run the `Main.java` file to execute the calculator program.
2. Follow the prompts to perform various calculations.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your needs!
